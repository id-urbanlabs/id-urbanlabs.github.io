At Urban Labs Indonesia, we conduct applied research to inform urban development policies and practices. Our work bridges data, policy, and planning — from spatial analysis and sustainability assessments to socio-economic studies — to support evidence-based decision-making at national and local levels.

We collaborate with academic institutions, government agencies, and international partners to co-create knowledge that addresses pressing urban challenges in Indonesia.
